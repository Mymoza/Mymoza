### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Iâ€™m Marie-Philippe Gill.

I am a content creator on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/girlknowstech), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/girlknowstech), and my blog [GirlKnowsTech.com](https://girlknowstech.com)!

Professionally, I work full-time as a machine learning engineer. I graduated from software engineering and a Master (M. Sc.) at Ã‰cole de Technologie SupÃ©rieure (Ã‰TS) in Montreal. I also have a college degree (DEC) in Computer Science.

I completed an internship at [Johns Hopkins University](https://girlknowstech.com/research-internship-jhu/). My research was on using smartwatches to predict the severity of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease symptoms, the [repo](https://github.com/Mymoza/BeatPD-CLSP-JHU) is public.
