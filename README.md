### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Iâ€™m Marie-Philippe Gill.

I am a content creator on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/girlknowstech), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/girlknowstech), and my blog [GirlKnowsTech.com](https://girlknowstech.com), that youâ€™re reading now!

Professionally, I will soon be looking to work full-time as a machine learning engineer. I just graduated from software engineering at Ã‰cole de Technologie SupÃ©rieure (Ã‰TS) in Montreal. I also have a college degree (DEC) in Computer Science. I am currently working on my masterâ€™s thesis.

I recently completed an internship at [Johns Hopkins University](https://girlknowstech.com/research-internship-jhu/). My research is on using smartwatches to predict the severity of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease symptoms, the [repo](https://github.com/Mymoza/BeatPD-CLSP-JHU) is public.

Pronouns: She & Her
